usage: simp [-h] [--commit] [--dry_run] [--fail] [targets [targets ...]]

Sort the import directives in Python files, excluding __future__.

positional arguments:
  targets        One or more Python files or directories with Python files.
                 Without arguments, runs simp on the current directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --commit, -c   Git commit the changes
  --dry_run, -d  If set, do not make the changes to the Python files, but just
                 list the diffs.
  --fail, -f     If set, the program fails if any changes need to be made. This
                 is useful for a commit hook to check if all imports are
                 sorted.

I wanted to sort my Python includes with no fuss. `simp` finds the first
block of unindented import statements, and sorts them. Any comments between
import lines bubble up to the top in their original order.
